# Project Images

To make the portfolio look complete, you need to add project images to this directory:

- `project1.jpg` - For the E-commerce Website project
- `project2.jpg` - For the Mobile Application project
- `project3.jpg` - For the Portfolio Design project
- `project4.jpg` - For the Web Application project

The recommended size is 800x600 pixels or a similar aspect ratio to ensure consistency in the layout. Images should be high-quality and representative of each project.

If you don't have specific project images, you can use placeholder images from:
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com)
- [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com)
- Or any placeholder service like [Placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com)

# Image Optimization Guidelines

This folder contains all images used in the portfolio website. To ensure optimal performance, please follow these guidelines:

## Image Size Recommendations

- **Profile Image**: 300 x 300px, JPEG format, max 200KB
- **Project Thumbnails**: 800 x 600px, JPEG format, max 150KB
- **Gallery Images**: 1200 x 800px, JPEG format, max 300KB
- **Background Images**: 1920 x 1080px, JPEG format, max 500KB

## Optimization Tools

You can use the following tools to optimize your images:

1. **Online Tools**
   - [TinyJPG](https://tinyjpg.com/) - Best for JPG compression
   - [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) - Advanced options for quality/size balance
   - [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/) - Simple compression

2. **Desktop Applications**
   - [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/) (Mac)
   - [FileOptimizer](https://nikkhokkho.sourceforge.io/static.php?page=FileOptimizer) (Windows)

## Best Practices

1. Always optimize images before uploading them to the website
2. Use WebP format when possible (with JPEG fallback for older browsers)
3. Consider using SVG for icons and simpler graphics
4. Don't upscale small images as this decreases quality
5. Keep image dimensions proportional to their display size

## Using the Image Optimizer Script

The website implements JavaScript-based image optimization to:
- Lazy load images (only when they are visible on screen)
- Resize oversized images to appropriate dimensions
- Show a loading placeholder while images are being processed

This helps improve page load times and overall performance.
